  **Note 1**: 这里"used"译为“ 习惯于；适应”，发音通常为/juːst/，其实在"used to/be used to"中一般都采用该发音，但是译为“用过的；旧的；二手的”时发音为/juːzd/，音标结尾的"st"变成了"zd"，这是结合了牛津词典的音标和韦氏词典的说明得出的结论；

  **Note 2**: "used to"和"be used to"意思是不同的，前者是“过去惯常做某事，而现在则不了”，后者是“习惯于、适应于”；

  **Note 3**: "used to"在牛津词典中是情态动词，发音为/ˈjuːst tu/，否定形式为"didn't use to"，其中use发音为为/juːs/，还有相对不常见的否定用法为"used not to"，及其缩写"usedn't to"，发音为/ˈjuːsnt tu/。

### Phrases/Words

- two orders of magnitude 两个数量级

  例：Two orders of magnitude refers to a difference in scale of 100 times. For example, if something is said to be two orders of magnitude larger than something else, it means that it is 100 times larger. This concept is commonly used in science and engineering to describe the relative size of different quantities. For instance, the difference in size between a microscopic cell and a human being is about three orders of magnitude, while the difference in size between the Earth and the Sun is about nine orders of magnitude. In general, an increase or decrease of two orders of magnitude represents a significant difference in scale.

  例：The difference in size between a bacterium and an elephant is about nine orders of magnitude.

  例：The speed of light is about **three orders of magnitude faster than** the fastest airplane.

  例：Do you think that, from the point of view of results, this exercise was worth the cost? 从效果来看，你认为这种锻炼值得花这笔钱吗？(意为“角度”)

  例：We argue that an infinite dimensionality of spiking networks with axonal delays is not a nuisance but an immense advantage that results in an unprecedented information capacity.

- discard sb/sth (as sth) 丢弃，抛弃

  例：10% of the data was discarded as unreliable. 10% 的数据因不可靠而被废弃。（感觉这里的“as”并不是上面词组里“as sth”里的“as”，而是conj.，意为“因为”，然后后面省略了“it is”）

- open/filled circles 空心/实心圆圈

- well-established adj. 确立已久的

  例：In principle, one can use RS cells to model all excitatory neurons and FS cells to model all inhibitory neurons. （来自论文“Simple Model of Spiking Neurons”，RS是regular spiking，FS是fast spiking）
  
- add up to 总共是，合计为

  例：The numbers add up to exactly 100. 这些数字的总数恰好是100。

  例：Larger simulations of several columns adding up to a million neurons
  (and 22 cells types) have also been performed. （来自论文“Towards a theory of cortical columns: From spiking neurons to interacting neural populations of finite size”）

- multifaceted *adj.* /ˌmʌltiˈfæsɪtɪd/ 多方面的；要从多方面考虑的；多才多艺的 having many different aspects to be considered (Oxford Learner's Dictionary 牛津);having a variety of different and important features or elements (柯林斯); having many aspects, skills, or qualities (Oxford English Dictionary 新牛津); having many faces or facets (Oxford English Dictionary 新牛津)

- widely recognized, generally accepted, well-recognized, acknowledged 这几个词都表示“公认的”

  区别为：

  "Well-recognized" is similar to "widely recognized" or "generally accepted", meaning that a fact, idea, or achievement is recognized by many people and has general agreement or acceptance. The difference is subtle, but "well-recognized" can suggest a higher level of recognition and agreement than "widely recognized" or "generally accepted."

  "Acknowledged" and "well-recognized" are similar in meaning, both referring to a general agreement or understanding that something is true or important. However, "acknowledged" is a more formal word, while "well-recognized" is more conversational.

  "Widely recognized" and "generally accepted" are also similar in meaning, but they emphasize the extent to which something is recognized or accepted, rather than the level of formality.

  例：The findings of the study are acknowledged by experts in the field.

  例：The importance of good nutrition is well-recognized by most people.

  例：The benefits of exercise are widely recognized in the medical community.

- Because a systematic link to microscopic models at the level of spiking neurons is missing, existing neural mass models must be considered as heuristic phenomenological, **albeit** successful, descriptions of neural activity. （来自论文“Towards a theory of cortical columns: From spiking neurons to interacting neural populations of finite size”）

  **Note**: albeit *conj.* /ˌɔːlˈbiːɪt/ 尽管；虽然 You use albeit to introduce a fact or comment that reduces the force or significance of what you have just said 例：He finally agreed, albeit reluctantly, to help us. 尽管勉强，他最后还是同意帮助我们。（感觉albeit最有特点的用法就是插入形容词、副词、介宾短语等，但也可以连接句子，例：①living a modest life as an editor wasn't as appealing as living in the grand style, *albeit* as someone else's valet. ② But suppose the life were in many ways a mess, *albeit* a fascinating, courageous, picturesque and emotionally intense mess … ③ Charles's letter was indeed published, albeit in a somewhat abbreviated form. 查尔斯的信确实被刊登了出来，尽管有些删节。）
