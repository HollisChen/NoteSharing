# Pronunciation-Intonation-Stress in English

## Pronunciation

### Normal and Strong Forms of "a" and "an"

Here is an explanation of the normal and strong forms of the indefinite articles "a" and "an" in English.

Normal Forms:

- "a": The normal pronunciation is the schwa /ə/ - an unstressed, neutral vowel sound. For example: /ə kæt/ "a cat".

- "an": The normal pronunciation is the schwa /ə/ combined with /n/. For example: /ən æpəl/ "an apple". 

The normal forms have a reduced sound because "a" and "an" are function words in the sentence. The preference in English is to stress the content words instead.

Strong Forms:  

- "a": The strong form is pronounced /eɪ/, with a long A sound as in the word "day". 
- For example: I need /eɪ/ NEW car! This puts emphasis on "a".
- "an": The strong form is pronounced /æn/, with the short A sound as in "cat". 
  - For example: It was /æn/ EXCELLENT speech! This stresses "an" for emphasis.  

The strong forms call attention to the article by using full, emphasized vowel sounds rather than reduced schwas. We use them when we want to stress "a" or "an" for clarity or impact.

In summary, "a" and "an" have both reduced pronunciations in normal speech (schwas) as well as full pronunciations (/eɪ/, /æn/) to emphasize them. Context and intent dictate which form we choose.

Here are two situations of using the strong form.

- Contrasting one noun with others.

  - Examples: "For breakfast I want **a** (/eɪ/) donut, not a (/ə/) bagel or muffin."
- Adding descriptive emphasis.

  - Examples: "It was **an** (/æn/) incredibly bright rainbow."

## Intonation (Pitch Patterns, Melody)

Intonation often refers to pitch patterns or melody in the context of language. This includes things like rising, falling, rise-fall tones.

### Rising Pitch

Rising pitch can signal questions. It is commonly found in yes-no questions, incomplete thoughts, or expressions of uncertainty.

Note: the following categories are not mutually exclusive; there can be some overlap.

- **Statement with Confirmation-Seeking**: When making a statement and seeking confirmation, the pitch may rise at the end.
  - Example: "You're coming to the party➚?"
    (The rising pitch typically occurs on the word "party" but might extend slightly beyond it.)
  - Example: "Maybe we could meet at 3➚?"
    (When expressing uncertainty or suggesting a possibility, the rising pitch conveys openness to discussion or negotiation.)
  - Example: "Maybe we should try the new Italian restaurant➚?"
  - Example: "Maybe we should try the new Italian restaurant➚ for dinner?"
    (The rising intonation usually occurs towards the end, but here is an additional phrase "for dinner" which introduces a slight pause and a drop in pitch before continuing the rising intonation. The pitch rises on "restaurant" and then falls slightly on "for dinner" before rising again towards the end. You can consider the rising intonation on "restaurant" indicates a degree of uncertainty or questioning about that specific part of the statement.)
- **Yes-No Questions**: Rising pitch is generally used at the end of a yes-no question.
   - Example: "Did you go to the store➚?"
   - Example: "Have you seen the new movie➚?"
   - Example: "Did you finish your homework➚?"
   - Example: "Can you help me with this➚?"
- **Softening or Politeness**: A rising pitch at the end of the sentence/phrase is appropriate to soften the statement and make it more polite and questioning in tone. 
   - Example: "Could you help me➚?" 
     (This can also be considered as a yes-no question.)
   - Example: "I was wondering if you could help me➚?"
     (Incomplete thoughts or suggestions often end with a rising pitch, suggesting that there is more to come or an expectation of a response.)
   - Example: "I was thinking it might be better this way➚."
     (A rising pitch signals a less assertive tone, thereby making it softer and more polite.)

### Falling Pitch

Falling pitch is versatile and can convey a sense of finality, completion, or assertion. It often occurs in wh-questions, declarative statements, commands, and completed thoughts. 
- **Command or Imperative Sentences**: Imperative sentences often have a falling pitch to indicate a command or request.
   - Example: "Close the door➘."
- **Wh-Questions**: Wh-questions (questions that start with who, what, when, where, why, etc.) often have a falling pitch at the end.
   - Example: "Where did you go➘?"
- **Declarative statements**: Declarative statements, which convey information or facts, often end with a falling pitch.
   - Example: "She works at the hospital➘."
- **Completed Thoughts**: When expressing a complete thought or idea, the falling pitch signifies the conclusion of the statement.
   - Example: "The movie was entertaining➘."

### Rise-Fall Pitch

Rise-fall Pitch is combination of rising and falling patterns, and is often used for lists, contrasts, expressing surprise, and showing excitement.
- **Lists or Series**: When listing items or series, there is often a rising pitch on each item, with a more significant rise followed by a falling pitch on the last item to indicate completion (in falling pitch part, we mentioned that falling pitch can refer to completion).
  - Example: "I need eggs➚, milk➚, and ➚bread➘."
   - Example: "For lunch, I made sandwiches➚, salad➚, and ➚soup➘."
- **Contrastive Stress**: Rising and falling pitch elements can effectively convey the speaker's intended emphasis and contrast.
  - Example: "She didn't take my **book**➚. She took my **money**➘."
    (The rise-fall pitch emphasizes the contrast between two items, highlighting the stressed word "book" with a rising pitch and the stressed word "money" with a falling pitch.)
  - Example: "I'm not talking about the **car**➚. I'm talking about the **bike**➘."
   (Same as the previous example. This pattern conveys the speaker's emphasis on distinguishing between the two items.)
- **Showing Surprise or Excitement**: Sheer surprise or excitement tends to involve a (bigger, more exaggerated) rise-fall pattern on the key exclamatory words rather than just a rising pitch. 
  - Example: "You did ➚WHAT?➘"
     (Sharp rise-fall on "WHAT" showing surprise)
  - Example: "You got the ➚JOB!➘"
     (Moderate rise-fall on "JOB" conveying excitement)

## Stress

Basically, stress involves giving greater emphasis to a specific syllable (word stress) or word/phrase (sentence stress) in terms of loudness (louder or quieter). But stress can also involve variations in pitch (higher or lower) and duration (longer or shorter). If you stress key words and phrases, you briefly pronounce them louder, longer, or at a higher pitch (or combination of them). 

- **Word Stress** focuses on emphasizing specific syllables within individual words. It's about how particular syllables are pronounced within a word. 

- **Sentence Stress** involves emphasizing certain words within a sentence to convey overall meaning and communicative intent. 

Here, we focus on sentence stress (sentence-level stress, also called phrasal or rhetorical stress), which helps convey meaning, focus, intent in longer utterances.

### Stress and rhythm

- Stress assigns accent at word/phrase level. Note sentence stress is at phrase level.
- Rhythm is a property combining stressed/unstressed units into patterns unfolding over time at sentence/discourse scale. You can see rhythm as the higher-level organizing structure that stress contributes to provides a richer perspective of its role in linguistic structure and processing. 

For example, stressing different words in "I didn't say he took the money" changes the implied meaning.

### Sentence Stress

Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are generally stressed, while function words (prepositions, articles, pronouns) are less stressed.

- Example: "I **can't believe** he did that."
  (emphasis on specific content words)
- Example: "I didn't say he took the money." 
  (Stressing different words in this sentence changes the implied meaning.)
