○ What is optogenetics?

Optogenetics is a technique in neuroscience that uses light to control the activity of neurons in living tissue. This is achieved by introducing into the neurons a gene for a light-sensitive ion channel or pump that can be activated or inhibited by light. When the gene is expressed and the neurons are exposed to light, the ion channel or pump is activated or inhibited, which leads to a change in the membrane potential of the neuron and, thus, its activity. The main advantage of optogenetics is that it allows for very precise control over the activity of individual neurons or populations of neurons. 

○ What is LFP?

LFP stands for Local Field Potential. Local field potentials are voltage signals that are recorded from electrodes in the vicinity of neurons. They are typically measured from extracellular electrodes, and reflect the summed synaptic activity of many neurons in a particular brain region.

LFP signals can provide valuable information about the activity of neural circuits and can be used to study a variety of phenomena, including oscillations, rhythmic activity, and synchronized neural activity. The LFP can also be used to identify the presence of particular frequency ranges that are associated with different cognitive or motor processes, and to study the dynamics of neural activity over time.

LFP signals are often recorded in conjunction with other neurophysiological measures, such as single-unit activity and spikes, to provide a more complete picture of the neural activity in a given brain region. In recent years, the use of LFP recordings has become increasingly widespread in neuroscience research, and LFP signals are now commonly used to study the brain activity of animals and humans in a wide range of paradigms.

○ What does "non-perturbative" mean?

"Non-perturbative" refers to a method or approach in physics, mathematics, or theoretical science that does not rely on perturbation theory, meaning it does not make small or incremental changes to a system to obtain a solution. Instead, it aims to solve a problem in its entirety without relying on approximations or small corrections. Non-perturbative methods are often used to study strong interactions or quantum phenomena where perturbation theory may not be applicable.

○ What is the escape noise?

"Escape noise" refers to a type of neural noise that is thought to play a role in generating spontaneous transitions from one state to another, such as from a resting state to an active state, or from one neural pattern to another.

Escape noise is thought to be generated by fluctuations in the membrane potential or in the activity of ion channels that are not related to any external stimulus, but instead reflect the inherent randomness of molecular processes in the neurons. These fluctuations can cause the membrane potential to cross a threshold, leading to the initiation of an action potential and a change in the state of the neuron. The term "escape noise" is used to describe this process because the fluctuations are thought to enable the neuron to "escape" from its current state and transition to a new one.

Escape noise is an important aspect of neural dynamics, as it contributes to the variability and unpredictability of neural activity, and has been proposed to play a role in the generation of rhythmic patterns, the formation of memories, and the computation of sensory information. Understanding the nature and effects of escape noise is an active area of research in neuroscience.

○ What is the synaptically-filtered background noise?

"Synaptically-filtered background noise" refers to the variability in neural activity that results from the interaction of neurons through synaptic connections.

In a neural network, the activity of one neuron can influence the activity of other neurons through the release of neurotransmitters at synapses. This interaction can result in fluctuations in the membrane potentials and spiking patterns of the neurons, even in the absence of any external stimuli. This variability in activity is referred to as background noise.

The concept of synaptically-filtered background noise refers to the idea that the properties of synaptic connections can shape the background noise in a way that filters out certain frequencies or patterns and enhances others. For example, the strength, time course, and specificity of synaptic connections can all influence the background noise in a neural network.

The concept of synaptically-filtered background noise is important for understanding the ways in which neural networks process and transmit information, as well as for understanding the role of synaptic plasticity in shaping neural activity and learning.
