â—‹ What is the Boltzmann distribution?

The Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that describes the distribution of energies among a collection of particles in thermal equilibrium. It is named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who developed it in the late 19th century as a way to describe the statistical behavior of gases.

The Boltzmann distribution gives the probability of finding a particle in a given energy state as a function of the temperature of the system and the energy of the state. The distribution function is given by the equation:

P(E) = (1/Z) * exp(-E/kT)

where P(E) is the probability of finding a particle in a state with energy E, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the system in Kelvin, and Z is the partition function, which is a normalization factor that ensures that the probabilities sum to one over all possible energy states.

The Boltzmann distribution has important applications in statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and many other areas of physics and chemistry. It is used to describe the distribution of energies among molecules in a gas, the population of electronic states in a solid, and the distribution of conformations in a protein, among many other examples.
